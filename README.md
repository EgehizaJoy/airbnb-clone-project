# AirBnB Clone Project

This project is a simplified clone of the AirBnB web application, developed as part of the Holberton School curriculum.

## 🌟 Project Goals

- Recreate key features of the AirBnB platform.
- Practice building full-stack web applications.
- Gain experience with teamwork, version control, and agile practices.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Python3, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **Frameworks**: Flask
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub
- **Others**: Jinja2, API development

## 📁 Structure

- `models/`: Data models
- `web_static/`: Static files (HTML/CSS)
- `console.py`: Command-line interface

## 👥 Team Roles

In this project, we adopted a collaborative software development structure. Below are the key roles and responsibilities, adapted from our project goals and industry best practices as outlined by ITRexGroup:

### 🔧 Backend Developer
Responsible for building the server-side logic of the application. Implements APIs, connects to databases, handles business logic, and ensures the system performs efficiently.

### 🗃️ Database Administrator (DBA)
Manages the database architecture and ensures data is correctly structured, stored, backed up, and retrieved efficiently. Also monitors performance and optimizes queries.

### 🎨 Frontend Developer
Implements the visual elements of the application that users interact with. Converts design mockups into HTML/CSS and connects UI to backend via JavaScript and APIs.

### 🧪 QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Tests the application at various stages of development to ensure all features work as intended. Writes test cases, performs manual and automated testing, and reports bugs.

### 👩‍💼 Project Manager (PM)
Oversees the entire development process. Sets deadlines, ensures communication among team members, tracks progress, and makes sure the project meets the defined goals and timelines.

### 🧠 UX/UI Designer
Designs user interfaces that are intuitive and aesthetically pleasing. Focuses on the overall user experience, accessibility, and visual consistency.

### 📄 DevOps Engineer (optional in small teams)
Automates deployment, manages servers, monitors system health, and ensures continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines are in place.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

Below is a breakdown of the technologies used in this project and their purpose:

### 🐍 Django
A high-level Python web framework that simplifies the process of building robust, secure web applications. Used for handling backend logic, URL routing, and server-side rendering.

### 🐘 PostgreSQL
A powerful, open-source object-relational database system used to store and manage application data. Chosen for its reliability and support for complex queries.

### 🔍 GraphQL
A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. Used to optimize data fetching between the frontend and backend.

### 🌐 HTML5 & CSS3
Core web technologies used to structure and style the user interface of the application. Essential for responsive and accessible design.

### 💻 JavaScript
Used to add interactivity on the frontend, handle dynamic content updates, and communicate with the backend via API calls.

### 🧪 Pytest
A testing framework for Python used to ensure the reliability of backend logic through automated tests.

### 🐳 Docker
Containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent environments across development and deployment.

### 🔁 Git & GitHub
Version control tools used for tracking changes, managing branches, and collaborating with team members.
